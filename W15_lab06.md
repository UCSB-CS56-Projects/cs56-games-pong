Observations:
The code compiles and runs smoothly. The game works fine. All of the ant targets work well and do what they are supposed to. 

Plans:
We plan on:

-Refactoring comments into javadoc style comments 
-Fixing the labels the the class diagram
-Adding the ability to pause the game and return to the main menu from the pause menu
-Adding different Extreme modes that each do unique things
