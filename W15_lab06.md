Observations:
The code compiles and runs smoothly. The game works fine. All of the ant targets work well and do what they are supposed to. 

Plans:
We plan on adding Junit tests, changing comments to javadoc format, adding a "pause game" functionality, along with other fixes. We also plan on cleaning up files, such as the build.xml file.
